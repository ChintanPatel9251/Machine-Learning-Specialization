# Machine Learning Specialization Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Machine Learning Specialization projects. This repository contains all the course projects and related documents that I completed while pursuing the Machine Learning Specialization offered on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University.


## Overview
The Machine Learning Specialization is a 3-course program that covers the fundamental aspects of machine learning, from basic regression and classification techniques to advanced learning algorithms and unsupervised learning methods.


## Courses and Topics
### 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
* **Linear Regression:** Understanding the basics of regression and implementing linear models.
* **Logistic Regression:** Applying logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
* **Gradient Descent:** Optimization techniques for training machine learning models.

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithms
* **Neural Networks:** Building and training neural networks for complex tasks.
* **Decision Trees:** Implementing decision trees for classification and regression.
* **Advice for ML:** Best practices and strategies for successful machine learning projects.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
* **Clustering:** Techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering for grouping data.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying outliers and anomalies in data sets.
* **Collaborative Filtering:** Building recommendation systems using collaborative filtering.
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Implementing content-based recommendation systems.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Basics of reinforcement learning and its applications.


## Projects
Each course includes several hands-on projects that apply the learned concepts to real-world data sets. These projects involve:
* Data collection and preprocessing.
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
* Model building, training, and evaluation.
* Implementing and fine-tuning advanced algorithms.
